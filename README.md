## A Bonus Project from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree 🎓

### Learning Backbone.js in the process!

This project uses Gulp to help construct itself. Sass and BrowserSync also help automate testing and streamline development by making it super-easy to test changes on the fly. 🖥

(Mostly? This project is just to help me stay in practice. Practice is important.) 👩🏽‍🏫
