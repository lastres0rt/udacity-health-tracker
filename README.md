A Bonus Project from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree 🎓

Learning Backbone.js in the process! 🍖 🤗

This project uses Gulp to help construct itself. 🥃 Sass and BrowserSync also help automate testing and streamline development by making it super-easy to test changes on the fly. ✈

I'm doing it with this project when I didn't before, because learning new technologies is half the fun (and it also makes the process faster and easier)! 🖥

(Mostly? This project is just to help me stay in practice and show I'm still playing with new technologies even after earning my nanodegree. Practice is very important.) 👩🏽‍🏫
