# Udacity Health Tracker

## A Bonus Project from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

### Learning Backbone.js in the process!

This project uses Gulp to help construct itself. Sass and BrowserSync also help automate testing and streamline development.

(Mostly? This project is just to help me stay in practice. Practice is important.)
